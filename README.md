# Overview
The biogas package is an R package for biogas research. It provides tools for processing biogas data, predicting biogas production, making conversions, and planning experiments. For example, the calcBgVol() function can be used for calculating biochemical methane potential from original measurements. See the vignettes and the links given below for more information.
