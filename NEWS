biogas 1.4.0 
2016 May 24
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

*cumBg()
New manometric method now available (use dat.type = "pres").

New option to use either cumulative or interval (default) data. See 'interval' argument.

BUG FIXES
*summBg()
Now returns error if 'when' argument is greater than available times for all reactors.

*cumBg()
Fixed error in cmethod = "total" calculation method. Now headspace volume is correctly 
added to cumulative production.

*Other minor fixes


biogas 1.3.0 
2016 April 14
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

*molMass()
New elements added to database. All elements with at least one stable isotope are now included. 
Examples:
molMass('CdSiO3')
molMass('FeSO4(H2O)7')

*molMass() and predBg()
Additional flexibility in chemical formula specification. Both of the following are acceptable.
molMass("H3C(CH2)5COOH")
molMass("(C6H12O6)0.25 (H3COOH)0.75")

*summBg()
New option for 'when' argument: set to "meas" to return a row for each measurement 
time (these may differ among reactors).

New 'sort' argument to sort results by reactor ID and time (default) or to match original order 
of reactor ID in setup data frame.

*predBg()
New options for 'value' argument to just return chemical reactions: use "reactionn" 
for a numeric reaction and "reactionc" for a character version.

biogas 1.2.0 
2015 November 13
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

*vol2mol()
New function for converting measured volume of CH4, CO2, and some other pure
gases to moles.

*predBg()
The 'mcomp' argument is more flexible now. Chemical formulas can now be mixed
with macromolecule group names. See help file and predBg vignette for examples.

New option for 'value' argument: "reaction". Returns a named numeric vector with
stoichiometric coefficients for the overall reaction, normalized to 1 mol of
substrate.

The 'mass' argument will be set to the sum of 'mcomp' unless it is set separately.
Previously the default value of 1.0 g was used even if 'mcomp' did not sum to
1.0. See help file and predBg vignette for more information.

*New vignette "Predicting methane and biogas production with the biogas
package" (referred to as the "predBg vignette" above).

BUG FIXES

*predBg()
'mcomp' is now mass-based (as originally intended). Earlier versions were
mole-based. See help file and predBg vignette for more information.

*Other minor bug fixes.

NEW PUBLICATION

*The gravimetric method used in mass2vol() is described in detail in a new
publication in Biomass and Bioenergy: Hafner, S.D., Rennuit, C., Triolo, J.M.,
Richards, B.K. 2015. Validation of a simple gravimetric method for measuring
biogas production in laboratory experiments. Biomass and Bioenergy 83, 297-301.

biogas 1.1.0

MAILING LIST

There is now a biogas package mailing list. To subscribe, send a message with
the subject "biogas: SUBSCRIBE" to saha@kbm.sdu.dk. 

NEW FEATURES

*New vignette "Getting started with the biogas package"

*Standard conditions and units
Standard temperature and pressure and units can now be set globally using
options().  This applies to stdVol(), cumBg(), vol2mass(), and mass2vol().
This option is strongly recommended for users not using default values (1.0
atm (101325 Pa) and 0 degrees C). Also, stdVol() (and functions that use it)
now displays the standard temperature and pressure. 

*Checking for input errors
All functions now include checks for the class and in some cases, the value,
of the arguments. Functions where a column name is specified (cumBg() and
summBg()) now check that the specified columns exist in the input data frames. 

*cumBg()
It is now possible to use a single composition value for each reactor, if it
is given in a data frame with no time column (just reactor ID and xCH4). If
this is the case but there is more than one composition value per reactor, an
error is thrown.

For the gravimetric method, the initial headspace correction can now be
applied (to the first interval only) using the headspace, vol.hs.name,
headcomp, and temp.init arguments.

*summBg()
Time can be totally ignored if there is a single observation for each reactor
and 'when' is set to NULL.

REMOVED FUNCTIONALITY

*Measurement pressure and temperature
Pressure and temperature (pres and temp arguments) both must now be specified
in order to determine standardized volumes for any function with a pres or
temp argument, so stdVol(), cumBg(), vol2mass(), mass2vol(). Previous versions
had a default pressure of 1.0 atm. Omitting pres or temp will now throw an
error or return non-standardized results (with a message).

*Column names in data frame arguments for cumBg() and summBg()
Names of ID, time, volume, composition, and other columns in input data frame
must now be specified using the ____.name arguments. The functions will no
longer match based on position. This change is meant to avoid errors caused by
incorrect positional matching when the user tried to use _____.name.

BUG FIXES

*predBg()
Fixed incorrect calculation of mass when mol argument was used for input.

OTHER CHANGES

*molMass()
The function now returns all digits--no rouding is done. 

*cumBg()
Calculation of methane volume in the volumetric method (default) now corrects
for the (very small, < 0.4%) difference in molar volume between CH4 and biogas
(this was already the case for the gravimetric method).

biogas 1.0.1
2015 May 28 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

summBg 
*Output data frame now includes value of 'when' argument that was
specified in the call.

*Will now work when only a single response ('vol.name') value is available,
but only if 'when' exactly matches the time or if 'extrap' is set to TRUE.

*The 'when' argument can now be a vector, i.e., a single call can return
results for different times.

*Separate contributions of substrate and inoculum are returned when 'show.obs'
is set to TRUE.
