There is now a biogas package mailing list. To subscribe, send a message with

NEW FEATURES

*New vignette "Getting started with the biogas package"

*Standard conditions and units
Standard temperature and pressure and units can now be set globally using
options().  This applies to stdVol(), cumBg(), vol2mass(), and mass2vol().
This option is strongly recommended for users not using default values (1.0
atm (101325 Pa) and 0 degrees C). Also, stdVol() (and functions that use it)
now displays the standard temperature and pressure. 

*Checking for input errors
All functions now include checks for the class and in some cases, the value,
of the arguments. Functions where a column name is specified (cumBg() and
summBg()) now check that the specified columns exist in the input data frames. 

*cumBg()
It is now possible to use a single composition value for each reactor, if it
is given in a data frame with no time column (just reactor ID and xCH4). If
this is the case but there is more than one composition value per reactor, an
error is thrown.

For the gravimetric method, the initial headspace correction can now be
applied (to the first interval only) using the headspace, vol.hs.name,
headcomp, and temp.init arguments.

*summBg()
Time can be totally ignored if there is a single observation for each reactor
and 'when' is set to NULL.

REMOVED FUNCTIONALITY

*Measurement pressure and temperature
Pressure and temperature (pres and temp arguments) both must now be specified
in order to determine standardized volumes for any function with a pres or
temp argument, so stdVol(), cumBg(), vol2mass(), mass2vol(). Previous versions
had a default pressure of 1.0 atm. Omitting pres or temp will now throw an
error or return non-standardized results (with a message).

*Column names in data frame arguments for cumBg() and summBg()
Names of ID, time, volume, composition, and other columns in input data frame
must now be specified using the ____.name arguments. The functions will no
longer match based on position. This change is meant to avoid errors caused by
incorrect positional matching when the user tried to use _____.name.

BUG FIXES

*predBg()
Fixed incorrect calculation of mass when mol argument was used for input.

OTHER CHANGES

*molMass()
The function now returns all digits--no rouding is done. 

*cumBg()
Calculation of methane volume in the volumetric method (default) now corrects
for the (very small, < 0.4%) difference in molar volume between CH4 and biogas
(this was already the case for the gravimetric method).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

summBg 
*Output data frame now includes value of 'when' argument that was
specified in the call.

*Will now work when only a single response ('vol.name') value is available,
but only if 'when' exactly matches the time or if 'extrap' is set to TRUE.

*The 'when' argument can now be a vector, i.e., a single call can return
results for different times.

*Separate contributions of substrate and inoculum are returned when 'show.obs'
is set to TRUE.
