Version 1.0.1

summBg 
*Output data frame now includes value of 'when' argument that was
specified in the call.

*Will now work when only a single response ('vol.name') value is available,
but only if 'when' exactly matches the time or if 'extrap' is set to TRUE.

*The 'when' argument can now be a vector, i.e., a single call can return
results for different times.

*Separate contributions of substrate and inoculum are returned when 'show.obs'
is set to TRUE.
